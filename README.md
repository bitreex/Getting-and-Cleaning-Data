# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
## Course Project Information

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. Required to submit: 1) a tidy data set, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

### Files included in this repo: <br/>

1) README.md -- high-level description of the code <br/>
2) run_analysis.R -- the code itself with some comments <br/>
3) Codebook.md -- name of the variables
